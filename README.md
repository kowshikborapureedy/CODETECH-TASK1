OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING BY PYTHON PROGRAMMING
OBJECTIVE:
Here is an example of a simple calculator in Python using **objective matter**. This is designed with an object-oriented programming approach, encapsulating functionality in a class.

The code has been refined into a fully object-oriented format, with a `Calculator` class handling the arithmetic operations. The `main` function serves as the entry point for user interaction, showcasing an objective approach. Let me know if you need further modifications!
KEY Activites
1. Define the Functionality
Decide what operations you want your calculator to perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. Organize Code into Functions
Write individual functions for each operation:
add()
subtract()
multiply()
divide()
3. User Input
Get input from the user for the two numbers and the operation they want to perform.
You might want to handle invalid input or unexpected scenarios (like division by zero).
4. Main Calculator Loop
Implement a loop that continues until the user decides to quit the calculator.
Provide options for the user to choose an operation or exit.
5. Output the Result
Display the result of the calculation back to the user.
6. Error Handling
Implement basic error handling to manage:
Non-numeric input
Division by zero
Invalid operation choice
7. Testing the Calculator
Test the calculator with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
